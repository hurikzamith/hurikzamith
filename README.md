## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm **Hurik Zamith**, a **Full Stack Software Engineer (backend-heavy)** with 2+ years of professional experience building and scaling fintech and healthtech products using **Ruby on Rails**, **MongoDB**, **Sidekiq**, and modern web stacks.

- Engineered critical backend features like **CPF data enrichment pipelines**, **relationship modeling engines**, and **modular logging frameworks**
- Reviewed code across squads to improve quality, performance, and maintainability

I also **founded and developed [Sazu Care](https://www.sazucare.com.br)** — a caregiver platform built from scratch with production-ready features such as user verification, scheduling logic, payments, and geolocation services.

In 2023, I graduated from **Le Wagon Bootcamp**, where I built:

- 🎮 *Rent Games*: A game rental platform inspired by Airbnb  
- 🎸 *Music Booking*: A music booking marketplace for artists and venues
